                        <p>The City of Long Beach was recently named one of the top <a href="http://www.longbeach.gov/civica/press/display.asp?layout=4&amp;Entry=4038">10 Digital Cities</a> by the Center for Digital Government and Government Technology and has been exploring ways to optimize government services through technology for some time now. Long Beach is a large American city boasting a vibrant mix of cultures, communities and business activity — from the corporate headquarters of Molina Healthcare, SCAN Healthplan and Epson America to significant R&amp;D operations for The Boeing Company and Mercedes Benz, complemented by a rapidly growing startup community centered around clean tech and mobile technology development.</p>
                        <p>The City is also home to one of the top public universities in the West, California State University Long Beach, the Office of the Chancellor for the Cal State System and a public school district recognized as one of the best urban districts in the country.</p>

                        <p>We’re working with the City of Long Beach to reduce avoidable utilization of emergency resources and improve health outcomes. During our research in February, we learned that as in a number of other cities, a small percentage of the population disproportionately utilizes emergency services. To back this up, we analyzed data from 2013 and found that 52 percent of emergency medical calls came from only the top 10 percent of addresses.</p> 
                        <p>We’re focusing attention on the addresses where people could use the most help and supporting city staff in taking action. Our project synthesizes and analyzes ongoing data from first responders, supporting city staff in taking action by:

                                <li>Supporting communication about actions to take at those addresses</li>
                                <li>Sending relevant notifications about actions taken and subsequent emergency calls.</li>
